This project was intended to create an executable command that displays my personal card. Thanks to Afonso Ramos for the idea.


## Available Scripts.

In this project , you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production.
It correctly bundles in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run clean`

If the node_modules folder exists, npm deletes it and installs a fresh one.

### `npm run compile`

It lets you perform any necessary building/prep tasks for your project, prior to it being used in another project.

### `npm run dev`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the program that analyses code for potential errors.

### `npm run prepublishOnly`

Runs before the package is prepared and packed, ONLY on npm publish.
